Recently it turned out, that I have been working with React for a little over 3 years, so now is the perfect time to summarize what I learned during this adventure.

Actually, all the things we are referring to here are not strictly related to the React library, they could be used by any software developer, regardless of their experience with any programming language.

Mastering them is one of the keys to becoming a good programmer and a valuable person in the team.

## Keep It Simple, Stupid

The first and most important principle is called "**KISS**" (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

It states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated, so simplicity should be a primary objective and any unnecessary complexions should be avoided wherever possible.

Usually the problems we face as developers have much, much more than the only solution. 

In most cases, the first way of reacting to the problem is not the most optimal one, but the one most often chosen.

There are various reasons for this, such as pressure from the client or the desire to complete this task faster and move on to the next one.

## Readability over everything

## Read the documentation

## Write tests

## Learn from your team
