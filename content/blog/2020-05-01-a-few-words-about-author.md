Hello, my name is Volodymyr Hudyma, I am a software developer **for more than 6 years**.

## About Me

I was born and lived in Ukraine until I turned 17 and had a big decision ahead of me.

Do you remember the time, when you just finished school and had to decide who you wanted to be in the future? I do.

That's one of the hardest decisions to make. But I was lucky and thanks to my parents we got it right - I started learning programming at the University of Information Technology and Management in Rzesz√≥w, Poland.

The studies continued, I immersed myself in the world of software creation and felt that this is what I want to do in the future, at least I promised myself to try.

Having studied hard to pass all university exams, I tried to find some time to learn coding by reading educational articles, watching videos on Youtube, and taking some free online courses.

After a few months of learning, it was obvious that I was ready to look for my first job.

I did a research and found that PHP developers were in high demand at the time (2014-2015), so I applied and succeeded.

## Commercial Experience

This is how my journey began in March 2015.

For the first 2 years, I worked as a full-stack developer, building both back-end and front-end, then I switched to pure front-end.

As of April 2017, I have been working with React. I decided to focus on this technology and learn it thoroughly to become an expert.

After completing many projects (from large commercial to small private), I realized that there was no better alternative at that point in time.

## Why React?

One of the biggest advantages of React - a strong community and ecosystem built around this library. It is supported and maintained by Facebook.

React is constantly updated with new features, which means that basically, everything you need to successfully complete the new project is already there and available for instant use.

React is SEO-friendly, it can run both on the server and the client.

React can be boldly described as "**learn once - write anywhere**". With the React library, you are able to build native apps for IOS and Android using the React Native framework. 

Finally, it is easy to learn.

## Why Did I Start This Blog?

The main reason, of course, is to expand my expertise, because the best way to learn something - is to teach it.

When you work as a JavaScript developer, you learn a lot of advanced concepts by using them almost every day, but you tend to forget the basics.

So I'm going to start by covering the most basic things that most of you probably know.

**Important Note:** Do not treat articles on this blog as the sole source of truth and think critically. Sometimes articles do not cover the topic 100%, be aware of that. You can always find better and more complete explanations on the internet. But be sure that all information provided here is written as simply as possible and includes many practical examples.
