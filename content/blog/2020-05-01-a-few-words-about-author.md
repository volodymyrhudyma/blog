## Hello,

my name is Volodymyr Hudyma, I am software developer for more that 5 years now. 

I was born and lived in Ukraine till I turned 17 and it occurred that there was a big decision ahead of me.

Remember those times, when you just finished school and had to choose who to become in the future? I do. 

That is one of the hardest decisions one has to make. But I was lucky and thanks to my parents, we did it right - I started learning **Programming** in **University of Information Technology and Management** in **Rzesz√≥w**, **Poland**.

The study went on, I was diving into the world of creating software and felt like that's what I want to do in the future, at least I promised myself to try.

Having studied hard to pass all university exams, I also had some time to learn coding at home by reading articles, watching videos on youtube, taking some free online courses.

After a few months o learning it was obvious that I was ready to search for my first job, so I did some researches and found out that PHP developers were in high demand at that time (2014-2015), so I applied and succeeded.

That's how my journey started in **March 2015**.

For the first 2 years I've been working as Full-Stack developer, building both back-end and front-end then switched to the pure front-end using React.js library.
