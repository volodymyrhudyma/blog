Hello, my name is Volodymyr Hudyma, I am software developer for more than 5 years now. 

## About me

I was born and lived in Ukraine till I turned 17 and it occurred that there was a big decision ahead of me.

Remember those times, when you just finished school and had to choose who to become in the future? I do. 

That is one of the hardest decisions one has to make. But I was lucky and thanks to my parents, we did it right - I started learning **Programming** in **University of Information Technology and Management** in **Rzeszów**, **Poland**.

The study went on, I was diving into the world of creating software and felt like that's what I want to do in the future, at least I promised myself to try.

Having studied hard to pass all university exams, I tried to find some time to learn coding by reading educational articles, watching videos on youtube, taking some free online courses.

After a few months of learning it was obvious that I was ready to search for my first job.

I did a research and found out that PHP developers were in high demand at that time (2014-2015), so I applied and succeeded.

## Commercial experience

That's how my journey started in **March 2015**.

For the first 2 years I've been working as Full-Stack developer, building both back-end and front-end then switched to the pure front-end.

I've been working with React.js from **April 2017**. I decided to concentrate on this technology and deeply learn it in order to become an expert. 

Having finished a lot of projects (from big commercial ones, to small private) I realized that there is no better alternative at the current moment.

## Why React?

One of the biggest advantages of React - strong community and ecosystem built around this library. It's backed up and maintained by Facebook.

React is constantly provided with the new features, which means that basically everything you will need for successful completion of a new project is already there and available for a use.

React is SEO-friendly, it can be run on the server as well as on the client.

React can be boldly called a “learn once – write anywhere”. Using React library you are able to build native apps for IOS and Android by using React Native framework.

Finally, it it easy-to-learn.

## Why did I start this blog?

The main reason is, of course, to increase my expertise, as the best way to learn something - is to teach it.

By working as a JavaScript developer, you learn a lot of advanced concepts by using them almost on daily basis, but you tend to forget the basics.

That's why I start with covering up the most basic things that probably most of you know.

**Important note:** do not treat articles in this blog as the only source of truth and think critically. Sometimes articles are not covering the topic in 100%, be aware of that. You can always find better and more complete explanations in the internet. But be sure that all information, provided here is written the simplest way it can be with a lot of practical examples.
