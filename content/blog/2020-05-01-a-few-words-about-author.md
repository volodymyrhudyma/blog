## Hello,

my name is Volodymyr Hudyma, I am software developer for more that 5 years now. 

I was born and lived in Ukraine till I turned 17 and it occurred that there was a big decision ahead of me.

Remember those times, when you just finished school and had to choose who to become in the future? I do. 

That is one of the hardest decisions one has to make.
