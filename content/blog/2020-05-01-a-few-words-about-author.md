## Hello,

my name is Volodymyr Hudyma, I am software developer for more than 5 years now. 

I was born and lived in Ukraine till I turned 17 and it occurred that there was a big decision ahead of me.

Remember those times, when you just finished school and had to choose who to become in the future? I do. 

That is one of the hardest decisions one has to make. But I was lucky and thanks to my parents, we did it right - I started learning **Programming** in **University of Information Technology and Management** in **Rzesz√≥w**, **Poland**.

The study went on, I was diving into the world of creating software and felt like that's what I want to do in the future, at least I promised myself to try.

Having studied hard to pass all university exams, I also had some time to learn coding at home by reading articles, watching videos on youtube, taking some free online courses.

After a few months of learning it was obvious that I was ready to search for my first job, so I did some researches and found out that PHP developers were in high demand at that time (2014-2015), so I applied and succeeded.

That's how my journey started in **March 2015**.

For the first 2 years I've been working as Full-Stack developer, building both back-end and front-end then switched to the pure front-end.

I've been working with React.js from **April 2017**. I decided to concentrate on this technology and deeply learn it in order to become professional. 

Having completed more than 20 projects (from big commercial ones, to small private) I realized that there is no better alternative for it at the current moment(**IMHO, let's see what Vue.js brings to the market with version 3.0**).

In order to remind myself some JavaScript concepts and how it works behind the scenes, I came up with an idea of starting this small blog in **April 2020**.

**Important note:** do not treat articles in this blog as the only source of truth and think critically. Sometimes articles are not covering the topic in 100%, be aware of that. You can always find better and more complete explanations in the internet. But be sure that all information, provided here is written the simplest way it can be with a lot of practical examples and use cases.

Thanks for visiting my blog, I hope you will learn a lot from here.

Please, do not hesitate to leave your feedback in the comments section below each article.

Be well, do good deeds and keep in touch.
