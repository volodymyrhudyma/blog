"**Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component**" - is one of the most popular warnings I React developers face.

I am one hundred percent sure that each developer encountered this at least once and did not know why that appeared and how to get rid of it.

To begin with, this warning is not something critical and seeing this does not necessarily mean that your application is not working as expected, but for sure the warning should not be omitted.

The warning notifies you that you tried to set the state of the component that has already been unmounted.

## What Happens If I Omit It?

The short answer is - it depends. It may or may not have a huge impact on the performance of React applications.

Let's assume that this warning is generated by the asynchronous call that waits for the completion and sets the local state of the component:

If only one component missed to handle the case of not setting the state after being unmounted, it has almost no impact on the performance.

But if there are a lot of such components (for example, a list) and all of them are not correctly implemented, them the impact is huge and the application will be slowed down noticeably.
