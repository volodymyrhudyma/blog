"**Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component**" - is one of the most popular warnings I React developers face.

I am one hundred percent sure that each developer encountered this at least once and did not know why that appeared and how to get rid of it.

To begin with, this warning is not something critical and seeing this does not necessarily mean that your application is not working as expected, but for sure the warning should not be omitted.

The warning notifies you that you tried to set the state of the component that has already been unmounted.

## What Happens If I Omit It?

The short answer is - it depends. It may or may not have a huge impact on the performance of React applications.

Let's assume that this warning is generated by the asynchronous call that waits for the completion and sets the local state of the component:

```tsx
const User = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // The warning is generated by this code
      // If the component unmounts faster than 3s
      setUser({
        id: 1,
        name: "John",
      });
    }, 3000);
  }, []);

  return <div>{user?.name || "No user found"}</div>;
};

```

If only one component missed handling the case of not setting the state after being unmounted, it has almost no impact on the performance.

But if there are a lot of such components (for example, a list) and all of them are not correctly implemented, the impact is huge and the application will be slowed down noticeably.

## Simple Example

A simple example is worth a thousand words, so let's create a simple React application that throws the warning.

**App.tsx:**

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

import User from './User';
import Project from './Project';

// Skipping the styles
const Wrapper = styled.div``;
const Button = styled.button``;

const App = () => {
  const [activeView, setActiveView] = useState('project');

  const toggleUser = () => {
    setActiveView('user');
  };

  const toggleProject = () => {
    setActiveView('project');
  };

  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <Button onClick={toggleProject}>Show project</Button>
      <Button onClick={toggleUser}>Show user</Button>
      {activeView === 'user' ? <User /> : <Project />}
    </Wrapper>
  );
};

export default App;
```

**User.tsx:**

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

const User = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // The warning is generated by this code
      // If the component unmounts faster than 3s
      setUser({
        id: 1,
        name: "John",
      });
    }, 3000);
  }, []);

  return <div>{user?.name || "No user found"}</div>;
};

export default User;
```

**Project.tsx:**

```tsx
import React from 'react';

const Project = () => <div>Project component</div>;

export default Project;
```
