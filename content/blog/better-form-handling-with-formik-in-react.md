Forms play a crucial role in modern web development, by enabling a possibility to gather information from the customers.

Good handling of them is a must in order not to lose any data by a stupid validation mistake or bug in the code, which is not always an easy task, especially if forms are of a big size.

While React definitely eases working with forms, it is still hard to build a maintainable, scalable, and testable solution without adding any helper libraries.

There are a lot of libraries, designed to make handling forms better, like [formik](https://www.npmjs.com/package/formik), [react-hook-form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hook-form), [redux-form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-form), or [react-final-form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-final-form).

Each one comes with its own pros and cons, but today we will focus on the most used and popular one - [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview).

## Step 1: Build A Basic Form

## Step 2: Add Formik

## Step 3: Validate Form
