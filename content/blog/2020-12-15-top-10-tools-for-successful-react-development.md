The developers usually have a set of tools that they use on a daily basis during the development of different projects.

They help to set up the project, speed up the development process, test the final result and make it accessible for the end users.

Today I am going to share with you the tools I personally use daily and find most helpful for the React developers.

## Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

To begin with, we need a good code editor that runs on the desktop and ships all necessary functionality that allows to start coding immediately after downloading.

**VS Code** fulfils these requirements, as it comes with a built-in support of a JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a lot of available extensions that could be installed on demand.

Here are some of the extensions I installed and find useful:

* [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) - allows to supercharge the Git capabilities built into Visual Studio Code

  My favourite use case is to glimpse into whom, why, and when a line or code block was changed, jump back through history to see how and why the code changed. Extremely useful when you jump into the existing project.
* [vscode-jest-runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=firsttris.vscode-jest-runner) - allows to runn or debug a specific test or test-suite

  When only a specific tests were changed and need to be run to make sure they pass, you do not have to execute `jest -t 'it should do something'` but just click on the button instead.
* [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) - allows to preview the Markdown in the realtime
* [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - allows to enforce a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules

  Extremely useful when working within a team to make sure everyone produces the code that follows the same guidelines.

There are way more amazing extensions, I recommend you to check [this article](https://x-team.com/blog/best-vscode-extensions/) for a bigger list.
