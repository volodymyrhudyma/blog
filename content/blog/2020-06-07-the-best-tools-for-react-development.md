After you decided to proceed with React, there is number of useful libraries that will help you to speed up the development process.

Choosing the right ones is crucial for the project's success.

To begin with, it's necessary to know exactly what is the size of the project.

Is it going to be a small one? medium? big?

**Important note:** I assume the small project takes up to 2 months of development for 1 person, medium - up to 12 and big - more than 12.

The technology stack, chosen for each project size can differ. It's generally a bad idea - to install a library which provides thousands of functions just to use a few of them. 

Large libraries tend to increase the application's size which leads to poorer performance.

Having that in mind, let's assume we are dealing with a medium-sized project.

## CRA

First and foremost, you have to decide if you are going to use the boilerplate (provided by the developers of React - **[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)** or any other available) or set up the project by yourself.

*Unless you are en experienced React developer, I recommend to use **create-react-app***.
