Git is probably the best tool for version control and successful collaboration of the development team. 

Typically, developers keep the codebase in one place, like Github or Gitlab, but in some cases it may be needed to work with the project that is stored in different locations and keep both of them in sync.

Today, after setting up two repositories, we will try to push and pull the changes from both of them simultaneously with just one command: **git push**.
