**Search Engine Optimization** (SEO) is a process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website from search engines.

A tremendous number of people use Google as a tool to search for information, so it is extremely important for your website to be ranked as high in its search results as possible.

The higher you are ranked, the more traffic you get, as simple as that.

Before we start learning what are the problems with SEO and React and how to get rid of them, let's get a quick overview of how websites are indexed by Google.

## Step 1: Crawling

There is no single place where all websites are registered, so Google has to constantly search for new websites and add them to its list.

It uses a lot of [Google Bots](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/googlebot) (web crawlers) that do this kind of work.

This process is called **crawling**.

## Step 2: Indexing

After your website has been found, Google Bot tries to understand what is it about by processing the text content, key tags and attributes, images, videos, and even more.

This process is called **indexing**.

The results of indexing are stored in Google index, an enormously huge database.

## Step 3: Ranking

Google implements an algorithm that decides what results from its index should be shown in response to user queries.

There are hundreds of rules which are used to determine relevant results.

Some of them are page loading time and mobile-friendliness, so make sure that your website loads fast and works well on mobile devices.

Check your website on the [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) to get some important information on what can be improved to rank even higher.

To get a deeper understanding of how the whole process looks read "[How Google Search Works](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/how-search-works)" from Google.
