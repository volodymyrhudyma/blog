**Search Engine Optimization** (SEO) is a process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website from search engines.

A tremendous number of people use Google as a tool to search for information, so it is extremely important for your website to be ranked as high in its search results as possible.

The higher you are ranked, the more traffic you get, as simple as that.

Before we start learning what are the problems with SEO and React and how to get rid of them, let's get a really quick overview of how websites are indexed by Google.

## Step 1: Crawling

There is no single place where all websites are registered, so Google has to constantly search for new websites and add them to its list.

This process is called **crawling**.

It uses a lot of [Google Bots](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/googlebot) (web crawlers) that do this kind of work.

## Step 2: Indexing

After your website has been found, Google Bot tries to understand what is it about by processing the text content, key tags and attributes, images, videos, and even more.

This process is called **indexing**.

The results of indexing are stored in Google index, an enormously huge database.

## Step 3: Ranking

Google implements an algorithm that decides what results from its index should be shown in response to user queries.

There are hundreds of rules which are used to determine relevant results.

Some of them are page loading time and mobile-friendliness, so make sure that your website loads fast and works well on mobile devices.

Check your website on the [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) to get some important information on what can be improved to rank even higher.

To get a deeper understanding of how the whole process looks read "[How Google Search Works](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/how-search-works)" from Google.

## How Is JavaScript Processed By Google?

JavaScript is used in almost every application these days because it provides us with many great features that allow building better, faster, and more powerful websites.

Websites built with JavaScript can render on a client or on a server and the rendering type defines how easy it would be for a Google Bots to crawl your website.

Server-rendered applications return HTML filled with all content in the HTTP response, while client-rendered applications do not.

HTTP response of a server-rendered application:

// IMAGE

HTTP response of a client-rendered application:

// IMAGE

if full HTML is not returned, Google Bots execute JavaScript and wait for the completion to be able to see the website data, which is indexed and stored afterward.

This process is complicated and there are many things that can go wrong, therefore relying on it is a bit risky.

In summary, while your client-side JavaScript application can be indexed, it is still better to use Server-Side or Pre-Rendering, as it makes your website faster both, for users and crawlers.

## Tip 1: Use Pre-Rendering

**Pre-Rendering** is a process of pre-loading of the website content with the help of Headless Chrome to prepare it for web crawlers.

> [Headless Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome) is a way to run the Chrome browser in a headless environment. Essentially, running Chrome without chrome! It brings all modern web platform features provided by Chromium and the Blink rendering engine to the command line.

Typically Pre-Rendering done with the help of a service (like [prerender.io](https://prerender.io/)), or a library (like [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap)) that intercepts all requests to your website and checks **user-agent** to determine whether a website is requested by a robot or a human.

If a viewer is a bot, it gets Pre-Rendered version of a website (cached HTML).

If a viewer is a human, a website is loaded normally.

#### Pros Of Pre-Rendering

* Allows Google to see the content for indexing
* Easy-to-implement (in comparison to Server-Side Rendering or isomorphic applications)
* Lighter server payload (in comparison to Server-Side rendering)

#### Cons Of Pre-Rendering

* Most services that can be used for Pre-Rendering are paid and work poorly with dynamic content

## Tip 2: Use Server-Side Rendering

With the **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** approach, HTML code is generated on the server.

Whenever a website is visited, the browser makes a request to the server which generates the HTML content and returns it back.

There is a great open-source framework called [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), that enables SSR for React-based web applications.

It relieves a lot of problems that are typically faced by the developers, trying to set up SSR from scratch, is easy to start with, and has awesome [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

Make sure to consider using it when building a website that requires good SEO.

#### Pros Of SSR

* Good for frequently-updated websites
* Fast initial load

#### Const Of SSR

* High server load

## Tip 3: Use Static-Site Generator

**Static-Site Generation** is a process of generating pages in the build time to make them available instantly after being requested by the user.

The biggest difference between the "traditional" approach (like SSR or Client-Side Rendering) is that instead of waiting for the page to be requested and generated on-demand, Statis-Site Generator does this in advance for every page you serve.

One of the greatest benefits is speed and Search Engines really like that.

**Statis-Site Generator** is a tool that takes your templates, fills them with content, and spits out HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

One of the most popular open-source Static-Site Generators is [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

It uses React in conjunction with GraphQL, has great documentation and many useful plugins that will make the development super fun.

#### Pros Of SSG

* Performance
* Flexibility
* Low server load

#### Cons Of SSG

* Hard to manage frequently-updated content - the website has to be re-build to generate newly added pages
* Long build time

## Tip 4: Build Isomorphic Applications

**Isomorphic (Universal) Application** - is an application that can run both on the server and the client.

In an Isomorphic Application, the first request is processed by the server and subsequent requests are processed by the browser.

This approach allows web crawlers to get full HTML code on their request and index the webpage.

#### Pros Of Isomorphic Apps

* Full SEO support
* Fast initial load
* Fast processing of subsequent requests on the client-side

#### Cons Of Isomorphic Apps

* Harder configuration

## Summary

There are a few ways to make your React application SEO-Friendly:

* Pre-Rendering
* Server-Site Rendering
* Statis-Site Generation
* Isomorphic Application

There is no "recommended" approach, each one comes with its own pros and cons, so to choose the proper way, you need to know exactly what type of application are you building.
