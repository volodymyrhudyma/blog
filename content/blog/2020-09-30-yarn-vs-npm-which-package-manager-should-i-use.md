In the JavaScript world, people share millions of pieces of code in order to avoid spending time on some necessary functionalities, which are already done by others.

Shared code, in turn, may depend on another piece of shared code and so on.

All these dependencies are managed by package managers, the primary function of which is to install some code from a global registry into an engineer's local environment.

Both, **yarn** and **npm**, are package managers for JavaScript applications.

## Npm

**Npm** is a default package manager for Node.js runtime environment.

It was written in JavaScript and initially released in January 2010 by Isaac Z. as a result of having "*seen module packaging done terribly*" and with inspiration from other similar projects such as PEAR (PHP) and CPAN (Perl).

It consists of the command line client and online database of private and public packages called the npm registry.

This registry is accessed via the client, and all available packages can be browsed via the [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/).

The package manager belongs to npm, Inc. that was acquired by the Github in March 2020.

## Yarn

**Yarn** is a package manager developed by Facebook as an alternative to **npm**.
