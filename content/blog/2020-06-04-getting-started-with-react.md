React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It lets you compose complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called “components”.

> **Library** - is a file or project that contains some useful functions.

## Why react?

There are a lot of benefits, but we'll take a look at the most important ones:

* **Easy to learn and use**

  React comes with a good supply of tutorials and great documentation as well as big ecosystem and community.
* **Learn once, write anywhere**

  An experienced React developer can write native apps for Android and IOS using React Native framework
* **Write once, use anywhere**

  In React you can create reusable components which help your code to be easier to maintain.
* **Implements Virtual DOM**

  React implements Virtual DOM which represents the real DOM as a JSON object and all operations on it are really fast.
* **Supports SSR(Server side rendering) as well as CSR(Client side rendering)**

  React can render both on server and client with minimum configurations.
* **Has great tools for developers**

  "React Developer Tools" is an extension for Chrome and Firefox that provides a set of inspection widgets to facilitate development. 

  If you're using Redux (state management library for react), you are provided with `redux-logger` library which is great for debugging.
* **React is popular**

  If you wonder whether to get your hands dirty with the new technology or not, try to find how many websites are using it. In case of React, we have: facebook, instagram, netflix, dropbox, codeacademy etc.
