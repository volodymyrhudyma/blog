Each programmer is used to write a code that acts like an instruction to the machine, telling it exactly what it should do to output the desired result.

Sometimes the code does not work as expected or the developer does not know how to solve something, so he starts looking for help by googling.

Finally, the answer is found on a specific resource, such as [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), which is well-explained by an unknown person who has spent some time submitting and explaining the solution.

In this example we are on one side of the coin, on the other side - there are developers who offer help and support by answering questions, explaining some topics in-detail by writing articles or offering mentoring.

Most of us have never thought of standing on the other side and looking at a problem from a different angle - from the perspective of an answerer, not an asker.

The question is - why? Surely we have enough experience to describe at least one problem we have faced recently, and the solution has been found to solve it.

In this article I will try to convince you why blogging is cool and what benefits it brings (in my opinion) and why you should start blogging right away.

## Pay the Debt

The first and most important reason is to "Pay the Debt". We all have a big debt to pay to less experienced developers, like those we learned from had.

Sounds weird? Let me explain. 

When new people start programming journey, they need a lot of resources to learn from.

Most of the best and well-structured ones are not available for free, so you tend to skip them and look for a free solution first.

There can be different reasons for this - maybe someone does not have enough money or is not sure that programming is what he wants to do in life, so it is completely understandable.

At some point, we find free courses that explain everything we need to know about a certain topic, we learn from it and grow professionally.

The creators of these free courses receive nothing from us for the time they spent creating, structuring, polishing and publishing resources (which is not quite true, but let's assume they could have earned much more if the courses were paid).

So basically we do not owe money for this course, but a debt we have to pay to less experienced colleagues when we grow up to the level of an expert.

I like to think in the following way - if I were to learn from 100 people, I would have to teach 10 times more.

## Extend Knowledge

## Build a Personal Brand

## Build Connection Network

## Increase an Income

## Practice Consistency
