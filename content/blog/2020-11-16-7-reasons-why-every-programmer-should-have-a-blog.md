Each programmer is used to write a code that acts like an instruction to the machine, telling it exactly what it should do to output the desired result.

Sometimes the code does not work as expected or the developer does not know how to solve something, so he starts looking for help by googling.

Finally, the answer is found on a specific resource, such as [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), which is well-explained by an unknown person who has spent some time submitting and explaining the solution.

In this example we are on one side of the coin, on the other side - there are developers who offer help and support by answering questions, explaining some topics in-detail by writing articles or offering mentoring.

Most of us have never thought of standing on the other side and looking at a problem from a different angle - from the perspective of an answerer, not an asker.

The question is - why? Surely we have enough experience to describe at least one problem we have faced recently, and the solution has been found to solve it.

In this article I will try to convince you why blogging is cool and what benefits it brings (in my opinion) and why you should start blogging right away.
