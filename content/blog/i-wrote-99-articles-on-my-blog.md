Back in mid-April 2020, almost a year ago I have decided to start my programming blog in order to expand my knowledge in some areas I felt I lacked it.

The journey began with a small introduction of myself and the reasoning behind kicking off.

Having finished the first post, I realized that writing is much easier than I initially thought.

The hardest part was to force sacrificing some activities to find a few hours of spare time and devote them to blogging, especially knowing that blogging is a long-term game and you would not get any significant returns in the near future.

After the first post there was the second, third and so on in just the next few days.

I felt so passionate about having an ability to share my knowledge with other programmers that I just couldn't stop writing and thinking a few articles ahead.

That was exactly the time I faced the number one mistake.

## \#1 Avoid Creating Routines That Lead To Emotional Burnout

> "Well, in our country," said Alice, still panting a little, "you'd generally get to somewhere else - if you run very fast for a long time, as we've been doing."

In a programming world, everything changes so fast that just to stay in the same place you need to keep improving yourself and learning as much as possible as often as possible.

Being on top requires even more energy, time and willingness to dedicate most of your time not only to learn, but to create.

It sounds a bit strange, but constant self-development is a huge source of stress and it's true not only for beginners.

A lot of people to keep their pace create unhealthy routines that have a negative impact on different areas of their life.

They don't keep the balance between the work and a good rest, putting the work in the first place which leads to quick emotional burnout and losing some control of your professional and personal life.

That's what I understood a few weeks after starting the blog - writing a good article on my blog is nowhere as important as regular switching to different other activities, that may be completely unrelated to programming.
