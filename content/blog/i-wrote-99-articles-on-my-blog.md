Back in mid-April 2020, almost a year ago I have decided to start my programming blog in order to expand my knowledge in some areas I felt I lacked it.

The journey began with a small introduction of myself and the reasoning behind kicking off.

Having finished the first post, I realized that writing is much easier than I initially thought.

The hardest part was to force sacrificing some activities to find a few hours of spare time and devote them to blogging, especially knowing that blogging is a long-term game and you would not get any significant returns in the near future.

After the first post there was the second, third and so on in just the next few days.

I felt so passionate about having an ability to share my knowledge with other programmers that I just couldn't stop writing and thinking a few articles ahead.

That was exactly the time I faced the number one mistake.

## \#1 Avoid Creating Routines That Lead To Emotional Burnout

> "Well, in our country," said Alice, still panting a little, "you'd generally get to somewhere else - if you run very fast for a long time, as we've been doing."
>
> "A slow sort of country!" said the Queen. "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"

In a programming world, everything changes so fast that just to stay in the same place you need to keep improving yourself and learning as much as possible as often as possible.

Being on top requires even more energy, time and willingness to dedicate most of your time not only to learn, but to create.

It sounds a bit strange, but constant self-development is a huge source of stress and it's true not only for beginners.

A lot of people to keep their pace create unhealthy routines that have a negative impact on different areas of their life.

They don't keep the balance between the work and a good rest, putting the work in the first place which leads to quick emotional burnout and losing some control of your professional and personal life.

That's what I understood a few weeks after starting the blog - writing a good article on my blog is nowhere as important as regular switching to different other activities, that may be completely unrelated to programming to preserve physical and mental health.

## \#2 Promote Your Blog Even If It Contains Only One Article

The second mistake was waiting for a specific number of articles before publishing them live and promoting on social media.

I thought that unless I have at least 20-30 good-quality articles, no one would ever visit my blog, as a lot of good content needs to be provided to interest your readers.

I also knew that after the blog is published, I would have to work a lot on SEO, but I had no idea how to do it properly.

It was always like - okay, I will add one more article and then maybe investigate this topic.

This led to me purchasing the domain and setting up a website while having 20 articles in my pocket.

Only the 21th was promoted properly and gained some traffic from both, Google and social media (I am mainly publishing on LinkedIn).

If I had to give you an advice - go live with the first ever article, gather feedback from your readers and learn from your mistakes.

## Posts Analytics

In this section I would like to share with you some analytics insights.

#### Most Popular Posts

Not all posts attracted a lot of visitors, but still there are some clear winners among all 99 articles that are published in this blog:

#### Least Popular Posts

The following posts weren't successful in terms of attracting traffic, even though I am fully satisfied with each of them:

The reason they haven't become popular is that I didn't promote them at all.

Lack of time to write a good-quality post, but need to publish an article in order not to give up on consistency leads to publishing articles I am not satisfied with:

* [Serve Build Folder In React](https://www.vhudyma-blog.eu/serve-build-folder-in-react/)
* [Return Multiple Elements From Render In React](https://www.vhudyma-blog.eu/return-multiple-elements-from-render-in-react/)
