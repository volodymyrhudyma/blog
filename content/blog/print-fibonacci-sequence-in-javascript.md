Fibonacci Sequence is a sequence of numbers, such as each number is a sum of two previous ones, starting from 0 and 1.

The example sequence: **0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34**, etc.

It can be represented by the following formula: **F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)**, where **F(0) = 0**, **F(1) = 1**.

Today we will learn a few ways to implement a function that returns the index value of the Fibonacci Sequence.
