The most fascinating part in creating a website from scratch is coding a technical part - that's what usually developers like the most.

But apart from that there are a few more important steps that should be taken before your website goes live, like hosting it with one of the available providers or own VPS server, purchasing a domain name and connecting them both.

As a hosting provider I like to use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) because of its simplicity and smooth deployment process you can create effortlessly.

As a domain registrar (a website where you can purchase a domain), I frequently use [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com/).

It is relatively easy to deploy your website to a hosting and purchase a domain, but it can be hard (especially for not experienced developers) to connect purchased domain with a website.

In this article, we will focus exactly on that.
