The most fascinating part in creating a website from scratch is coding a technical part - that's what usually developers like the most.

But apart from that there are a few more important steps that should be taken before your website goes live, like hosting it with one of the available providers or own VPS server, purchasing a domain name and connecting them both.

As a hosting provider I like to use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) because of its simplicity and smooth deployment process you can create effortlessly.

As a domain registrar (a website where you can purchase a domain), I frequently use [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com/).

It is relatively easy to deploy your website to a hosting and purchase a domain, but it can be hard (especially for not experienced developers) to connect purchased domain with a website.

In this article, we will focus exactly on that.

## Prerequisites

For the purposes of this tutorial I have:

\- Created a new React project (`npx create-react-app react-ninja`)

\- Created a new private Github repository and pushed the code there

\- Bought a [](http://react-ninja.com/)domain on GoDaddy ([react-ninja.com](https://react-ninja.com), expires on **02/10/2022**)

\- Deployed a simple React application on Netlify (<https://optimistic-poincare-0f17ae.netlify.app/>)

*Read one of my previous article - [Deploy Your React Application To Netlify](/2020-07-06-deploy-your-react-app-to-netlify-july-2020/) if you don't know how to do it yet.*
