Server-side rendering(SSR) has become increasingly popular in recent years.

By using it, we can do many things that are not possible with a client-side rendering approach. 

The main advantages of SSR are:

* Better SEO
* Better performance
* Better UX

Before we proceed with the detailed discussion of the benefits of both approaches, we should familiarise ourselves with them.

## Client-side rendering

**Client-side rendering** means that our page is rendered in the browser by JavaScript.

Instead of getting the HTML page populated with the content, we get an empty page that contains some JavaScript, which is responsible for filling the page with the content.

Example HTML response:

**Important note:** notice, that `<div id="root"></div>` element, which will render the whole React app is empty.

After executing JavaScript files, the whole React application will be rendered inside the `<div id="root></div>` unless you change that:

**Important note:** notice, that `<div id="root"></div>` element is not empty now, React application is rendered inside.

The following steps are executed to make an application visible after the user opens a website:

1. The browser makes a request to the server:

   \- "Hey, server! Could you send me the contents of the website?"
2. The server answers the browser with a simple HTML structure, containing links to all styles and JavaScript files:

   \- "Ok, here you go!"
3. The browser downloads all JavaScript files:

   \- "Thanks, buddy. I see there are some JavaScript files. Let's download them first."
4. The browser executes React code:

   \- "The download is complete. Time to run the scripts."
5. If no errors occurred during the execution, the app is ready for use:

   \- "Ok, I got it for you, my dear user. Now it is time to have a little rest."

During the execution time of all the above steps, the app is not viewable, because we simply do not know yet what to display.

It is good practice to show the loading screen or some placeholders while the data is being retrieved to make the user feel that something is happening and the initial loading does not really take much time.

#### Pros

* After slow initial load, all next pages will be loaded much faster

  Client-side rendering manages the routing dynamically without refreshing the page every time a user requests a different route, that's why it's extremely fast after loading the first page.
* Lower server load

  CSR technologies use the processor on the client device to perform the bulk of the logic.

  That means processing power is offloaded from the server and transferred down to the client.

  **However, there is one potential drawback** of the CSR: the users with underpowered devices can experience lag issues as their devices struggle to render the page due to the lack of resources.

  Nowadays this drawback has become less of a concern, as CPUs get cheaper and more powerful.

#### Cons

* Slow initial load

  There is a need to download and execute JavaScript on the initial load. 
* SEO issues

  CSR requires a **two-wave process** for JS rendering and indexing in a browser.

  **The first wave** requests source code, crawls and indexes any present HTML and CSS, adds any present links to the crawl queue and downloads page response codes.

  When using the CSR approach, thereâ€™s basically nothing for Google to index in the source code, as all that we have is the simple HTML without any data yet.

  **The second wave** can occur a few hours to even a few weeks later, Google returns to the page when additional resources are available to fully render and index the JS generated content.
* Caching issue

  Since the HTML is not available in the initial render, browsers cannot cache the HTML structure of the page.

## Server-side rendering

**Server-side rendering** means that our page is rendered on the server.

When the user opens a website, the HTML received from the server is populated with the content:

![HTML structure after executing JavaScript on the server](/img/screenshot-2020-07-04-at-12.36.35.png "HTML structure after executing JavaScript on the server")

**Important note:** notice, that the React application is rendered inside `<div id="main"></div>`.

#### Pros

* Fast initial load
* Good for SEO

#### Cons

* Full page reloads
* High server load
