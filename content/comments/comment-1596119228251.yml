  Hey, americanman! 


  Thanks for leaving a comment, I will try to answer your questions. 

  To begin with, hook is a simple function that lets you use state and other
  React features in functional component.

  It is React-specific feature, not really a new syntax. Hook is just a simple
  JavaScript function.


  When you pass "0" to the "useState" hook, it will return "0" as the first
  element of an array which will get destructured into "count", and "setCount"
  function (you can name it as you want, it's just a good practice to follow the
  naming convention) as the second element.


  Later you won't have to use "setState", but "setCount" which calls "setState"
  internally.


  I recommend you to read the documentation, it's awesome:
