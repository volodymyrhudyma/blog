  Hey Vova, very cool article.


  I think that in the "Logical AND" section you confused the "returnMe" and
  "notReturned" strings, by that I mean, that in truthy values section:

  1 && "notReturned" // => "notReturned"

  should probably be

  1 && "returnMe" // => "returnMe"


  and in falsy values section:

  null && "returnMe" // => "null"

  should probably be

  null && "notReturned" // => "null"


  Other than that, great read! :)

  It's always nice to see improvements to my favorite programming language :)
