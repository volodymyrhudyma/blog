  Hi, please read the following article:
  "https://vhudyma-blog.eu/yield-expression-implicitly-results-in-an-any-type-because-its-containing-generator-lacks-a-return-type-annotation"
  which explains why this error occurs and how to fix it. Unfortunately, you
  would not resolve it with just adding "return" as I previously mentioned.
