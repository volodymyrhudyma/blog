  Nice article. I agree you don’t always need redux, especially for small
  projects, but the above does not scale well, so should only be used on small
  projects. 


  It’s often hard to know upfront if your project is small. RTK imho is easier
  to setup than all the above, so if in doubt I’d recommend just going with it.
  It will save you time in the long run and your DX will be far nice!


  I really recommend people read
