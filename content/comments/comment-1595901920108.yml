  Nice article, can you look in my questions?


  what even is a hook?

  Is it for javascript or what a beast it is?

  is it a new syntax JS world?

  just look at it:

  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  So we have array with two values in it.

  then we have useState function with passed 0 argument;

  so it looks like the function returns some value and add assigns it to count?

  but then later on you can use setState(argument) and assign some value to
  count, how is that works?

  Thank you.
